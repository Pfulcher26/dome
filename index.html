    <p>This is a dome, Anna, you said.  Then you said goodbye forever.  Your death has meant not a thing to me.  We are two cyborgs fucking in the wilderness.  I grab onto your shoulder blade and chew off your ear.  I’m ready for it.   There was a penguin once.  Its wet fur glistened.  We screwed off its head.  It was a robot in disguise.  Its head was a little camera.  It was watching us make love.   I have no respect for penguins anymore.  I wouldn’t trust one as far as I could throw it, though I wouldn’t dare.  I seriously have respect for living creatures.   That is one thing I am serious about.  One time we gouged out a penguin’s eyes.  We cornered it in the woods.  It was a primeval forest.  Fucking in the wilderness.  You were always a solipsist at heart.  We were thrusting in the bracken when the penguin came up behind us.  We heard its shy footsteps.  I screamed.  You got up and started choking it.  I got up, too, and approached it from the other angle, so that it was pinioned against a tree.  Then you gouged out its eyes.  But it was only a robot.   In any case, your death has meant nothing to me.  Your dick was unimpressive.  But your spirit was lovely, I admit. This is a dome, Anna, you said, and then your eyes caught on fire and you threw up flames.  Where is the home you promised me?  Where is your love?  I’m so naked without it.  I’ll never be whole again.  I’m sad dating a sad robot that looks like Jude Law.  I’m so tired of sad robots.  All of them want to be Jude Law for some reason.  Skin like acetate.  I’ll suck him off and leave him to freeze in the McDonald’s parking lot.  I ordered a plastic heart necklace off of Amazon.  I wore it when I was making love to Josh who never respected my pronoun.  I told him that I was going to kill him after we finished.  I’m shivering naked beneath the sheets.  I look in the mirror, my skin is sagging; my teeth are falling out.  Purple liquid oozes from my eyes and nose.  I’m getting loose all over.  My bones are expanding and disappearing.  I’m stretching.  Enormous flaps of skin are hanging down from arms, fusing into my sides.  I’m mutating into a giant moth.  Josh knocks on my door.  I so can’t speak right now.  I try screaming, go away, but it’s useless, all I can do is this high-pitched moth squeak.  Go away, Josh.  Squeeeaaaaak!  You come in.  I can’t help it.  I bite your head off.  It’s what moths do.  It’s sooooo sexy.   Blood is gushing up from your neck, spraying all over the ceiling.  I can feel the steam.  Your body collapses.  It’s so pitiful.  You’re sooooo cute when you’re decapitated.  I love you, Josh, even if you never respected my pronoun.  I lick up your blood with my proboscis.  I’m so full.  I wish I could eat you again.  I’m horny still, but I guess I’m going to watch some Netflix and pass out.  In the morning I’ve got a terrible hangover.  Your death has meant nothing to me.  </p>
