    <p>This is a dome, Anna, you said.  Then you said goodbye forever.  Your death has meant not a thing to me.  We are two cyborgs fucking in the wilderness.  I grab onto your shoulder blade and chew off your ear.  I’m ready for it.   There was a penguin once.  Its wet fur glistened.  We screwed off its head.  It was a robot in disguise.  Its head was a little camera.  It was watching us make love.   I have no respect for penguins anymore.  I wouldn’t trust one as far as I could throw it, though I wouldn’t dare.  I seriously have respect for living creatures.   That is one thing I am serious about.  One time we gouged out a penguin’s eyes.  We cornered it in the woods.  It was a primeval forest.  Fucking in the wilderness.  You were always a solipsist at heart.  We were thrusting in the bracken when the penguin came up behind us.  We heard its shy footsteps.  I screamed.  You got up and started choking it.  I got up, too, and approached it from the other angle, so that it was pinioned against a tree.  Then you gouged out its eyes.  But it was only a robot.   In any case, your death has meant nothing to me.  Your dick was unimpressive.  But your spirit was lovely, I admit. This is a dome, Anna, you said, and then your eyes caught on fire and you threw up flames.  Where is the home you promised me?  Where is your love?  I’m so naked without it.  I’ll never be whole again.  I’m sad dating a sad robot that looks like Jude Law.  I’m so tired of sad robots.  All of them want to be Jude Law for some reason.  Skin like acetate.  I’ll suck him off and leave him to freeze in the McDonald’s parking lot.  I ordered a plastic heart necklace off of Amazon.  I wore it when I was making love to Josh who never respected my pronoun.  I told him that I was going to kill him after we finished.  I’m shivering naked beneath the sheets.  I look in the mirror, my skin is sagging; my teeth are falling out.  Purple liquid oozes from my eyes and nose.  I’m getting loose all over.  My bones are expanding and disappearing.  I’m stretching.  Enormous flaps of skin are hanging down from arms, fusing into my sides.  I’m mutating into a giant moth.  Josh knocks on my door.  I so can’t speak right now.  I try screaming, go away, but it’s useless, all I can do is this high-pitched moth squeak.  Go away, Josh.  Squeeeaaaaak!  You come in.  I can’t help it.  I bite your head off.  It’s what moths do.  It’s sooooo sexy.   Blood is gushing up from your neck, spraying all over the ceiling.  I can feel the steam.  Your body collapses.  It’s so pitiful.  You’re sooooo cute when you’re decapitated.  I love you, Josh, even if you never respected my pronoun.  I lick up your blood with my proboscis.  I’m so full.  I wish I could eat you again.  I’m horny still, but I guess I’m going to watch some Netflix and pass out.  In the morning I’ve got a terrible hangover.  Your death has meant nothing to me.  </p>

    <p>I’m going to stop talking in this obnoxious valley girl accent.  Though it’s only obnoxious if you think it is.  I don’t mind it.  In fact,  I feel as though I’m losing something by surrendering it.  My oppidum is crumbling.  Come on, let’s go, into the past.  Into the age of ancient man.  Wake up, Jacque!  The hut is cold.  We live in a little skin hut on the edge of the lake.  Not as nice as some of the one’s we saw at IKEA, but it’s in our price range.  Jacque is a man of lyrics.  He lies in drink and sometimes grunts out a soliloquy in spite of himself.  Of what inner flowers?  I can’t imagine.  Our skin hut sits on the edge of a great glacial lake.  The swans swoop in and out all spring.  Their whooping gets so loud it’s painful to the ears, but Jacques says it inspires him.  I captured a sick one once.  I tried to nurse it back to health.  It died.  Perhaps from a brain eating amoeba.  I made a flute out of the wing bone.  Strong and hollow.  Sometimes Jacque, blind with drink, will stumble naked to the edge of the lake and, in the bone chilling currents, play a lament for the past.  The amoeba is likely what he has in mind.  Amoibḗ.  Change.  For that is the way all life tends.  It’s encoded in our cells.  The flute’s song is haunting.  Jacque’s breath is toxic.  His heart is full of bacteria. He’ll die soon, I know it.  I slap him on the face. He’s not moving.  I knock on his forehead.  Hellooooooo!  I turn him over on his side and undo the sinews of his tunic.  I take the flute from where it lies by the fire.  It’s almost out.  I use the tinder fungus to ignite a new piece of kindling.  The flame sputters back.  Green flame.  Sometimes in these late hours, I hear the stars hissing through it.  It is a gateway to another dimension.  I feel the flute along its smooth eminences.  It’s warm.  I tease the flute up Jacque’s anus.  In the Spring, I will wear the nice grass cape and my mollusk shell necklace.  Maybe we’ll have another visit from the Iceman before then.  I have a vision of the future.  I’ve invented the best-selling word processing program Microsoft Word.  I’ve been alive for thousands of years.  I have my own private blimp.   But in spite of my riches, my favorite pigeon doesn’t visit me anymore.  I lay my head down on my windowsill and feel the cold sink into my cheek.  Do you even know how much I loved you?  Does it matter to you at all?  I took it too far.  I always take things too far.  This is a dome, Anna, and then his face melted.  I’m going to make your heart explode with my brain.  The next time I see you.  I’ll have to tell you about Josh then, too.  How I so ate his head.  And I’ll tell you about how my old boyfriend before Josh that self-destructed.  That one, I don’t remember his name.  Julio.  I tried often and without success to stick my finger up his ass.  He really didn’t like to have fun.  You like to have fun though, don’t you?  You look sexy in those new sneakers.  I’m going to buy you a new belt with my part-time job at JC Penny.  I’m the last person to work at JC Penny ever.  They’re shutting everything down.  Remember when malls used to have ice skating rinks?  What total excesses of the naïve heart.  I can’t go even one night without chocolate.  As if.  Comfort bitter.  Elegant bitter.  Ah, eee, uh, eh, oh.   Ah, eee, uh, eh, oh.  Ah, eee...Aaaaaaaayuh, bee, bee, aaaayah.  Fin.  Spastic nebulae.  Isn’t life fantastic when  you’re sad?  And I’m sad at all times.  My fingers are wrinkled with age.  Too many half-assed attempts.  I hope we’re still friends on Facebook.  Release all the tension.  Let’s eat the colored sand and relax.  I sooooooo wanna fuck you to the rhythym of your heartbeat.  Oh god, this is so shitty.  Slow fuck in the sunrise.  That’s a promise.  The snow is swirling  outside of the apartment.  Another century at an end.  Like, right?  Only 83 more years.  Sadness.  We’re practically at the finishline.  Practically already out of time.  Our hearts could stop any minute.  Julio didn’t like my finger up his ass, but maybe he didn’t consider how little time we have left.  Mind expansion, bitch. Open your heart.  Finger up the ass.  Unleash the mojo.  Kazi is a healer and Teta is a magician, but I can see the future.  I pick up the guitar.  I like to keep it strung in gold strings like the Kings of Ulster.  I play a lament for the past and present, but I exclude the future.  The future’s going to be lit... in emarald fires of fortune, just not for us.  I’m going to stop talking in this obnoxious valley girl accent.  Though it’s only obnoxious if you think it is.  I don’t mind it.  In fact,  I feel as though I’m losing something by surrendering it.  My opidium is crumbling.  Come on, let’s go, into the past.  Into the age of ancient man.  Wake up, Jacque!  The hut is cold.  We live in a little skin hut on the edge of the lake.  Not as nice as some of the one’s we saw at IKEA, but it’s in our price range.  Jacque is a man of lyrics.  He lies in drink and sometimes grunts out a siloquy—we’ve done this already.  </p>
